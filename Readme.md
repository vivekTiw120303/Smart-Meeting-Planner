ðŸ§  Reflection Questions
1. How did you use AI in this project?
Used ChatGPT to scaffold the FastAPI structure, handle time conflict logic, and generate frontend templates. Success: fast prototyping. Failure: needed tweaking of overlapping time logic.

2. What would you add if you had 2 more days?
# Persistent DB (SQLite)
# Timezone support
# User authentication
# Drag-and-drop calendar UI
